# Broker Frontend (Admin Panel)

Quick scaffold for the admin panel built with Vite + React + Tailwind.

Run locally:

```bash
cd front
npm install
npm run dev
```

App will be served at http://localhost:5173 by default.

Notes:
- This scaffold focuses on the admin panel routes under `/dashboard/admin`.
- Integrations (auth, real API, socket server) are placeholders and should be connected to your backend.
